excerpt: "Reflections on the practical steps and ethical challenges in preparing an IRB for international language documentation."
---

This invited talk shares my experience navigating the IRB process for an international language documentation project. I walk through the full arc: from fieldwork design to protocol writing, and from paperwork challenges to ethical reflection.

The project centers on documenting **Tikhir**, a Trans-Himalayan language spoken in eastern Nagaland. I highlight the realities of working across borders and institutions, especially when your participants are multilingual, your infrastructure is fragile, and your documentation goals don’t quite match standard IRB templates.

### What I Covered

- Why IRBs are necessary for field linguists (even when harm is unlikely)
- How I assembled the required components: protocol, consent, recruitment, and study materials
- What caught me off guard (like the need for a local review letter)
- Resources and templates I leaned on
- Lessons for future students navigating similar approval processes

I also reflected on how IRB expectations differ from academic ones: clarity, risk-benefit framing, and audience matter more than disciplinary nuance.

For those preparing a similar application, I’d recommend starting early, being transparent, and framing your work with both academic and participant-centered lenses in mind.
