This invited talk, presented to students at Nagaland University, introduced core issues in research ethics and methodology, especially for students beginning independent research or fieldwork.

The talk covered:
- What counts as plagiarism, and how to avoid it
- Proper citation and the idea of crediting inspiration, not just direct quotes
- The ethical stakes of language data collection and representation
- Fieldwork ethics, including privacy, informed consent, and participant agency

I also discussed linguistics-specific conventions like glossing (Leipzig rules), formatting, and documentation best practices. We closed with a discussion on what students found most helpful and how to think critically about what counts as "common knowledge" in academic writing.
