Hi! I'm Patrick Das, a third year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at CU Boulder.

I'm interested in how human history and cognition interact to shape the patterns of language diversity we see in the world today. My work focuses on introducing multilingual, highly complex scenarios which our current theories in linguistics fail to account for, despite being incredibly common. In the past, this has manifested itself in my research on heritage language maintenance in intra-national diaspora communities in world cities like Delhi, where residents have to navigate their cities using a complex, multifaceted translinguistic repertoire. In my current work, I look at linguistically complex and diverse zones like North-East India (better understood as part of the larger Eastern Himalayan Region), and question whether anthropological areas: areas that have been identified to have long-standing confluence in ecology, culture, language and social norms, also show convergence in linguistic patterns.
