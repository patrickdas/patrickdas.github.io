Hi! I’m Patrick Das, a fourth year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Colorado Boulder.

I study how human history, geography, and cognition shape patterns of linguistic diversity. My research combines fieldwork, spatial analysis, and typological comparison to understand how languages change under contact — particularly in multilingual, politically complex regions.

My dissertation focuses on [**Tikhir**](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/tikh1241), a Trans-Himalayan language spoken in eastern Nagaland, India. Working closely with the Tikhir community, I document dialect variation, examine patterns of language shift, and explore how space and place have shaped the language. You can read more about this work [here](/tikhir/). This research is supported by a [2025 Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Innovation Fellowship](https://www.acls.org/fellow-grantees/patrick-das/).

Some of my other research interests are:
- Areality and contact linguistics
- Linguistic landscapes and translinguistic repertoires
- Noun classification and gender systems
- Modal expressions in language

Outside of linguistics, I enjoy playing chess, making coffee, or spending too much time on Football Manager.
