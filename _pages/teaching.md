## Teaching Overview

As an instructor and teaching assistant in linguistics, I’m committed to fostering curiosity, analytical rigor, and inclusivity in the classroom. My teaching spans introductory and advanced topics in linguistic typology, semantics, and morphosyntax.

I approach teaching as a collaboration — encouraging students to question assumptions, engage deeply with data, and connect linguistic theory to real-world language use.

## Courses Taught and Supported

- **[LING 1020: Languages of the World](/teaching/ling1020CE/)**  
  *Instructor* (Summer 2024 - 2025)  
  Designed and taught a remote undergraduate course introducing students to the diversity of human languages, their structures, and social functions. I used a research-led approach, assigning current typological readings in place of a textbook, and guided students through linguistic analysis via scaffolded weekly reflections and cumulative assessments.

- **[LING 1020: Languages of the World](/teaching/ling1020TA/)**  
  *Teaching Assistant* (Fall 2022 - Fall 2025)  
  Led discussion sections, graded assignments, and supported an introductory course on linguistic diversity, typology, and global variation.

- **[LING 2000: Introduction to Linguistics](/teaching/ling2000TA/)**  
  *Teaching Assistant* (Fall 2023)  
  Assisted students with core concepts in phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. Designed and graded quizzes and facilitated weekly review sessions in a flipped classroom model.

- **[LING 5430: Semantics and Pragmatics](/teaching/ling5430GR/)**  
  *Grader* (Spring 2024)  
  Evaluated graduate-level assignments in formal semantics and pragmatics, providing detailed feedback on predicate logic, metaphor, and prototype theory.
