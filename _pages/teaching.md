## Teaching Overview

As an instructor and teaching assistant in linguistics, I’m committed to fostering curiosity, analytical rigor, and inclusivity in the classroom. My teaching spans introductory and advanced topics in linguistic typology, semantics, and morphosyntax.

I approach teaching as a collaboration — encouraging students to question assumptions, engage deeply with data, and connect linguistic theory to real-world language use.
