## Tikhir Language Documentation Project

This project centers on the documentation and description of **Tikhir**, an endangered Trans-Himalayan (Tibeto-Burman) language spoken in the eastern edge of **Nagaland**, India. The Tikhir community occupies a linguistically and culturally rich region near the Indo-Myanmar border — a place where multilingualism is the norm, and language change is unfolding rapidly.

## Why Tikhir?

Tikhir has never been formally described in the linguistic literature, and is under increasing pressure from both neighboring regional languages and larger sociopolitical forces. Yet, it exhibits deep internal variation — across villages and generations — that speaks to larger questions about how languages evolve under contact.

This project documents:
- **Dialects and variation** across villages and age groups
- **Grammatical features** shaped by local multilingual ecologies
- **Place names, oral histories, and cultural knowledge** embedded in language
- **A collaborative dictionary and sketch grammar**, created with community input

## Fieldwork and Methods

I work closely with members of the Tikhir community and the **Tikhir Literature Board** to document variation and linguistic change in ways that are locally relevant and academically rigorous. My methods combine:
- **Participant-driven fieldwork** and long-term community collaboration
- **Spatial analysis** of dialect variation and language contact
- **Ethnographically-informed documentation**, placing language in its social and geographic context

I’m grateful to ACLS for supporting a project that bridges language documentation, spatial humanities, and community partnership.

I'm also thankful to my advisor, [Prof. Hannah Haynie](https://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/hannah-haynie), and my external mentor, [Dr. Kellen Parker van Dam](http://patkai.ist/), for their guidance and mentorship.
