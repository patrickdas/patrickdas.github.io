## Research Overview

I study how languages change through contact — particularly in multilingual, geographically complex, and politically underrepresented regions. My research brings together **language documentation**, **typological analysis**, and **spatial methods** to understand how structural patterns emerge and shift in contact zones.

I work primarily in the **Eastern Himalayan region**, where deep historical multilingualism, political borders, and shifting alliances produce dynamic language ecologies that challenge existing models of typology and inheritance.

## Dissertation Project  
**Language, Space, and Contact in the Eastern Himalayas**

My dissertation investigates **Tikhir**, a Trans-Himalayan language spoken in eastern Nagaland, India. Working closely with the Tikhir community, I examine:

- Dialectal variation across village networks  
- Contact-driven structural change  
- Language shift under sociopolitical pressure

This project combines community-led documentation with spatial and areal analysis to understand how languages interact over time and space.
