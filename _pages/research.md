## Research Program

My research focuses on the interplay between syntactic typology and areal diffusion, particularly in multilingual, politically complex regions. I am especially interested in how language change is shaped by geography, cognition, and long-term contact — often in contexts where our existing models of linguistic diversity fall short.

## Dissertation Project: Language, Space, and Contact in the Eastern Himalayas

My dissertation explores language contact in the Eastern Himalayan region through the documentation and spatial analysis of Tikhir, an endangered Tibeto-Burman language spoken in eastern Nagaland, India. Tikhir speakers live at the intersection of multiple language ecologies and face pressures from both local contact dynamics and larger political and economic forces.

This project contributes:
- a detailed documentation of a previously undescribed language,
- a spatial model of dialect variation and contact,
- and an account of how language change unfolds in a politically marginalized, multilingual region.

## Other Projects

### Heritage Language Use in Urban India
A previous project examined heritage language maintenance in Delhi’s urban diaspora communities. I investigated how speakers navigate their cities with complex translinguistic repertoires — patterns of language mixing and alternation shaped by identity, setting, and institutional constraint.

### Areality and Morphosyntax
More broadly, I explore how historical and functional pressures shape linguistic areas. My work draws on typological data and fieldwork to understand how syntactic constructions — like classifiers, evidentials, or differential object marking — diffuse across unrelated languages through long-term contact.
