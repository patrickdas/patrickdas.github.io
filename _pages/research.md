## Research Overview

My research explores the interplay between **syntactic typology**, **language documentation**, and **areal diffusion**, especially in politically complex and multilingual regions like the **Eastern Himalayas**.

I'm particularly interested in how languages evolve under long-term contact and how we can better model these processes through a combination of **fieldwork**, **spatial analysis**, and **typological comparison**.

## Dissertation Project  
**Language, Space, and Contact in the Eastern Himalayas**

My dissertation focuses on the documentation and spatial analysis of **Tikhir**, a Trans-Himalayan language spoken in eastern Nagaland, India. This work addresses:

- Dialect variation across villages
- Contact-driven change and multilingual ecologies
- Language shift under sociopolitical pressure
