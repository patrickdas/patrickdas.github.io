**Role:** Grader  
**Term:** Fall 2023  
**Institution:** University of Colorado Boulder

I served as the grader for LING 5430, a graduate-level course in Semantics and Pragmatics. My responsibilities included evaluating assignments on a wide range of topics such as:
- Predicate logic and scope
- Prototype theory and metaphor
- Conversational implicature and presupposition
- Syntax-semantics interface

In addition to assessing technical accuracy, I provided detailed feedback aimed at sharpening studentsâ€™ formal reasoning and analytical writing. This experience deepened my engagement with formal semantics and honed my skills in evaluating advanced linguistic argumentation.
