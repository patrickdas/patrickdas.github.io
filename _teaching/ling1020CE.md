I designed and taught an online, accelerated version of LING 1020, introducing students to global linguistic diversity through typology, historical change, and language contact. The course emphasized research papers over textbooks, with weekly reflections and guided discussions. By the end, students developed a foundational understanding of linguistic structures and their real-world applications.
