**Role:** Teaching Assistant  
**Terms:** Fall 2022 - Fall 2025
**Institution:** University of Colorado Boulder

As a TA for LING 1020, I supported an introductory course that explores the diversity of human languages around the world. My responsibilities included:
- Leading weekly discussion sections
- Holding office hours and providing one-on-one support
- Designing and grading assignments and quizzes
- Supporting in-class activities that introduced students to linguistic structures and global typological variation

I worked to make the material accessible and engaging for students with a wide range of academic backgrounds, and emphasized real-world examples from underrepresented language communities.
