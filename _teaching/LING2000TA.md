**Role:** Teaching Assistant  
**Terms:** Fall 2023
**Institution:** University of Colorado Boulder

As a TA for LING 2000, I led weekly discussion sections, developed and graded quizzes, and facilitated student understanding of core linguistic concepts, including phonetics, morphology, syntax, and semantics in a flipped classroom model. I aimed to create an engaging environment that encouraged analytical thinking and practical application of linguistic theory.
