I'm honored to be named a 2025 ACLS Dissertation Innovation Fellow!

This fellowship will support my ongoing fieldwork and research on the Tikhir language in Northeast India, part of a larger effort to understand how multilingualism, geography, and deep history shape language change in the Eastern Himalayan region.

I’m especially grateful to my advisor, [Prof. Hannah Haynie](https://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/hannah-haynie), and my external mentor [Dr. Kellen Parker van Dam](http://patkai.ist/) for their unwavering support. I’m also thankful to the Tikhir community and the Tikhir Literature Board for welcoming me into their world and working alongside me.

You can read more about the project on my [research page](https://patrickdas.github.io/research/).

Excited to share updates and the work this fellowship will help make possible.
